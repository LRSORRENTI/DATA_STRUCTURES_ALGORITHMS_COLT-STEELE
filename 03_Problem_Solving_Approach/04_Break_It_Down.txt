=============
BREAK IT DOWM
=============

Take the problem and chunk it down, 
break it into more bite-size manageable 
chunks 

Explicitly write down the steps you think 
need to be taken to solve the problem

Often times these may not be the correct 
steps right off the bat, but that's the point: 

Write these steps down, think about them, why 
are they needed for the solution, are there 
better steps? 

Can these steps be morphed into 
more concise steps? 

Write down the basic components that compose the 
solution to the problem

This forces you to think about the code you'll 
write before you write it, and helps you catch 
any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings
before you dive in and have to worry about the 
details (e.g. language syntax) as well
