============================
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM FIRST
============================

As a quick note, many of these techniques 
are noted in George Polya's 'How To Solve It' 
book, a great resource for anyone interested in 
how these problem solving techniques are developed 
at a ground level, it's more slanted towards 
mathematics, but it's an excellent resource 

Understand the problem fully before spending 
   time solving it, it's easy to skim over things
   without fully understanding the problem, there's 
   nothing worse than spending a half hour trying to solve
   a problem which you don't fully understand, you'll 
   waste a lot of time if you don't reflect on the problem
   and understand the framework and structure of the 
   problem itself first 

============================================================

For a new developer, one of the most challenging 
things is learning how to devise your own solutions 
to complicated problems, often real development
problems are complex, requiring thought and 
understanding before tackling them 

============================================================

Here are some guidelines to understand any problem:

1. Restate the problem in your own words 

2. What are the inputs that structure the problem

3. What are the outputs? What are the best case 
   solutions to this problem? 

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? 
   Do we have enough information to solve the problem?
   (This may not be answerable at the beginning setup 
   stage, but it's important to keep this question
   on the back-burner when thinking about solving)

5. How should the components that comprise 
   the problem be categorized? How do we label these 
   important pieces of data?

============================================================

Let's look at a practice question, someone asks 
you: 

Write a function that takes two numbers and returns 
the sum

Let's walk through this problem using the above steps

1. Restate in my own words:
   
Okay we need a function that will add up two input 
parameters and return the sum as an output 

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? 

We'll have two number inputs passed in as arguments
these number inputs will need to be added together

3. What are the outputs that come from the solution? 

We need to implement an addition inside the function, 
that way the output will be returned as the sum of the 
two input arguments

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? 

We may need to do a type check to make sure that 
whoever passes in the arguments, only passes in numbers 
and not any other data type, as long as we have two 
numbers we have enough info to solve the problem 

5. How to label the important pieces of data? 

We need to label each line of code, what it's doing 
each step of the way,
