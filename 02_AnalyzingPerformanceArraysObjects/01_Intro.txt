ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE 
OF ARRAYS AND OBJECTS

``````````````````````````

Now that we've covered Big O, remember O(1), and 
O(log n) are very good!

In this section we're going to learn which methods 
might be more advantageous over another, and in which 
circumstances, we'll also look at the Big O of 
objects and arrays, and their performance

``````````
OBJECTIVES

``````````

- Understand how objects and arrays work through 
  lens of Big O 

- Learn why adding elements to the start / beginning
  of an array is costly

- Compare and contrast run times for arrays and objects 
  as well as built-in methods, that way we can see 
  how simpler methods perform before getting into 
  more complex algorithms
