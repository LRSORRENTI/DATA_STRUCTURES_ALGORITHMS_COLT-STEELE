/*

======================
BIG O OF ARRAY METHODS
======================

Quick note, memorizing this info 
is not necessary, the goal is to become 
aware that different methods will 
have different time and space complexities

Understanding the basics will help you be able 
to look at an algorithm, and have an informed 
idea of what it's time complexity is, remember, 
we count operations as a rule of thumb

Here's a quick overview, YOU DON'T NEED TO MEMORIZE:

- .push() O(1)

- .pop() O(1)

- .shift() O(N)

- .unshift() O(N)

- .concat() O(N)

- .slice() O(N)

- .splice() O(N)

- .sort() O(N * log N)

- .forEach/map/filter/reduce etc.. O(N)
