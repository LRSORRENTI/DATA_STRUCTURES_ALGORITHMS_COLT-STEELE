============================
EXAMPLE OF MULTIPLE POINTERS
============================

Write a function called sunZero that accepts a 
sorted array of integers, the func will find the 
first pair where the sum is 0, then return an array 
that includes both values that sum to zero or 
undefined if the pair doesn't exist in the data 
structure we're searching 

sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]) // [-3, 3]

sumZero([-2, 0, 1, 3]) // undefined 

sumZero([1, 2, 3]) // undefined 

An important caveat here is that we're looking at 
sorted arrays in these examples, if they were not 
sorted we'd need to think about other ways to 
devise efficient solutions 

But they are, so we know that since the arrays are sorted 
we can use two pointers to find the solution
