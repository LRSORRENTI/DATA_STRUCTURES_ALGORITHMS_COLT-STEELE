MULTIPLE POINTERS PATTERN
=========================

The idea behind multiple pointers is that 
we create pointers or values that correspond to 
an index or position and move towards the 
beginning, end or middle based on a certain 
condition 

Very efficient for solving problems with 
minimal space complexity as well!

Basically what it comes down to is that we 
have some kind of structure, like an array 
or a string, or even a doubley-linked list

Usually we're searching for something in 
this array or string, typically a pair of 
things 

WE use two references, maybe we have one at 
index 0, and one at the final index and we 
search in both directions going towards 
the middle

The main takeaway is that we use multiple points 
aligned towards a goal
