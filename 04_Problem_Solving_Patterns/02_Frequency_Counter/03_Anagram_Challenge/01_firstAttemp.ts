ANAGRAMS EXERCISE

``````````````````

To test our knowledge of the frequency counter
we'll try out a problem: 

Given two strings, write a function to 
determine if the second string is an anagram
of the first string argument 

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed 
by rearranging the letters of another, such 
as: 

Cinema is an anagram with Iceman 

'cinema' and 'iceman' true

'cat' and 'tar' // false 

'cat' and 'tac' // True 

*/

/*
Ok so psuedo-code wise how do we do this? 

Well first we need to declare a function called 
validAnagram, specifying two argument params that are 
strings: 

function validAnagram(str1: string, str2: string)
