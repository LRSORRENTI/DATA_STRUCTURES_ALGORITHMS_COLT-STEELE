==================
FREQUENCY COUNTERS
==================

The frequency pattern is where we use an object
collect values, and their respective frequencies

This can often avoid the need for nested loops 
or O(n^2) 

Remember O(1) is very good, as is O(log n)

This frequency counts most when you have many pieces 
of data, many different inputs coming in that 
need to be checked

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or 
quadratic: O(n ^ 2) operations with arrays and strings
