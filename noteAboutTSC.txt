NOTE: I added the global ts-node
command for quickly running TS 
code: ts-node myFile.ts

Just a note, I'm having difficulty setting up the 
tsconfig so that it auto outDir's any compiled 
TS to JS files into the dist directory

The command I'm using to do this since I can get 
tsc typescriptfile.ts to auto compile into dist
(Work on that config later)

Is: 

tsc myTSFile.ts --outDir ../dist 

the double dot is needed to escape out of the 
current directory, then it will auto-compile into 
dist
