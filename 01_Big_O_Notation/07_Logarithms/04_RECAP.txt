1. To analyze performance of an algorithm we
utilize Big O notation

2. Big O gives us a high level understanding 
of the time or space complexity of an algorithm

3. Big O doesn't care about precision, only 
the general trend on a graph, is it linear, 
constant, or quadratic?

4. Time and space complexity measured by Big O
depends on the algorithm, not the hardware used 
to run the algorithm

5. Big O is everywhere, it's the one that's 
referenced often in regards to time and space 
complexity of algorithms

=========================
BIG O WILL REMAIN WITH US
FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE 
COURSE SO THERE'LL
BE PLENTY OF TIME TO 
PRACTICE!
