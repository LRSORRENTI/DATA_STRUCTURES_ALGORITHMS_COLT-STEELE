===================
WHY THIS IS CRUCIAL
===================

In this course, we'll learn 
searching ALGORITHMS, and it's 
IMPORTANT to be able to instantly 
know: 

Ok this is O(1) or O(log n) it's very fast!

This one is O(n) or (nlog n) it's not very fast!

And efficient sorting algorithms involve LOGARITHMS

And Recursion (function calling itself until base case)
also involve log space complexity


Just remember the chart! O(n) is slower than 
O(log n) 

And O(log n) is slower than O(1)

But all are faster than quadratic!
