LOGARITHMS AND SECTION RECAP

````````````````````````````

Something to keep in mind is that the Big O
we've measured so far have been common 
complexities, O(1), O(n), O(n^2)

But Big O is often very complex, requiring 
more involved mathematical expressions

One that appears very often is the LOGARITHM

This is because ofen times, algo's will be 
O(log n) not just O(n)

=============================================

LOGARITHMS ARE THE INVERSE OF EXPONENTIATION!

=============================================

Just like division and multiplication are 
brothers, or go hand in hand, so are LOGARITHMS 
and ALGORITHMS

logâ‚‚(8) = 3 or log2(8) = 3
