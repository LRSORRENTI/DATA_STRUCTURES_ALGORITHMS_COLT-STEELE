SPACE COMPLEXITY
================

Thus far, we've only been concerned with 
time, how fast a given algo is compared to 
another, that's time complexity, analyzing the 
run time of an algo as the input size increases

We can still utilize Big O for space complexity:
How much additional memory do we need to allocate 
in order to run the code inside our algorithm?

``````````````````
What about inputs?

``````````````````

Remember, as n grows, the size of the input 
grows, we'll ignore that 

But you'll often hear the term auxiliary space complexity
to refer to space required by the algo only, 
not including the space taken up by the inputs 

That's what we care about the algorithm itself
