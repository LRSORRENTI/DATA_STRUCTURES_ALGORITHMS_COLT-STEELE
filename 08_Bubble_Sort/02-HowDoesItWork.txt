How does it work?
=================

Many sorting algos involve some type of swapping 
functionality (e.g. swapping nums to put them in order)

const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
}

Or es5: 

function swap(arr, idx1, idx2) {
    var temp = arr[idx1];
    arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
    arr[idx2] = temp;
}

Bubblesort pseudocode: 

- Start looping from a variable i at the end of the array, 
  final idx towards the beginning

- Then inner loop with a variable j from the beginning 
  until i - 1, i referring to the i of the first loop

- if arr[i] is greater than arr[j + 1] swap those two !
