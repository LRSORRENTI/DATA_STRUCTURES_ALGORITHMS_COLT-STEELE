Bubble Sort
===========

Bubble sort isn't the most efficient, but generally 
it's not implemented all the time

But it's a good algorithm learn, especially since other 
algos improve upon it 

It's a sorting algorithm where the largest 
values in an array bubble up to the top, ascending numeric 
order 

In essence we loop through an array, and we check each 
time if the current value is greater than the index 
we're checking, we swap and use that value 

Is it larger? Swap, not larger? Don't swap 

So with every iteration, the large values will bubble 
up to the top

This algorithm will depend on the iterations themselves, 
it won't sort everything the first pass, but with 
every repeat of the loop, the large values slowly bubble 
up 

And with each pass we have one less item in the array we 
need to check, if we have an array of: 

[2, 1, 5, 4]

once after that first pass we have 5 at the last index, so 
we don't need to check it again, the array indexes we 
need to check will get progressively smaller as more items 
or values become sorted
